We have two data sets ‘geno train.txt’ and ‘geno test.txt’. 
Each contain 16 columns of data from different individuals, with the first 15 being the genetic fingerprint the count of the number of repeats for certain so-called tandem repeats in the genome and the last being the population variable. 
The purpose is to predict the population from the genetic fingerprint. 
We refer below to the repeat counts as the count data (the x variables) and the population as the group (the y variable).


We will estimate the density for different population class.
